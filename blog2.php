           <h2 class="subheader">Thoughts on Grace Hopper 2018</h2>
                   <p>I was super lucky to be able to attend Grace Hopper Celebration in Houston last week; I jumped on the opportunity when my school (Seattle U) ended up having an open spot for an attendee when someone dropped out last minute and I was the first person to respond to the post about it! I had to pay for my own lodgings/travel but the not inexpensive registration fee was covered as well as the fact that registration had sold out months prior. I was very excited and nervous as this was the first professional conference I had ever attended.<br />

My first impression of the conference was two weeks prior when I was signing up for sessions. There were sooooooo many sessions and most of them were full so I was slightly disappointed. I did see a few “mentoring” sessions which I jumped on because, to be honest, I really wanted connections and the opportunity to network because securing an internship for next summer sounded like a dream come true.<br /><br />

It wasn’t until I met with a few of the other Seattle U Grace Hopper attendees and the professor sponsoring us that I learned about the career fair that was pretty much the main attraction of GHC. It goes all three days and it’s MASSIVE. It was then that I realized just how much opportunity there was at GHC to network and try to find career opportunities. We were told to print out at least 50 copies of our resume to bring to GHC if we were thinking about attending the career fair; I printed out 60. Nice paper and all.<br /><br />

The conference was overwhelming. It was amazing. There were so many lovely ladies there and very few men which was very refreshing. To work in a male-dominated space is quite exhausting and it was a needed change of pace to live in a different world for three days.<br /><br />

I ended up skipping every single session I signed up for and instead spent the three days of the conference living in the Career Fair hall networking as much as possible. I learned alot and also have been fortunate enough to be in the interview process with several companies because of GHC.<br /><br />

Ok so here comes the main reason for this post: What I would have done differently if I could go back in time before GHC, and what prospect attendees should keep in mind if they are planning on attending GHC.<br />

Firstly, and something not entirely under one’s control, I would have pursued the Grace Hopper Scholarship opportunity. What I know about it is that you need to apply early and fill out a scholarship application which I assume has some essay questions and question about grades blah blah, but from what I’ve seen it’s worth it. Not only do you receive travel/lodgings/registration for free, but you also get your name thrown into a pool with the other GHC scholars where companies who are attending the conference can look for possible hirees and schedule interviews ahead of time. As someone who was mainly looking for interviews and hiring opportunities, this would have been amazing for me. Obviously I didn’t have the opportunity to do it since I was late to register anyways, but my friend was a Grace Hopper Scholar and she had an interview with Disney set up before the conference even started. She ended up getting an amazing offer for their summer 2019 software engineering internship and I’m soooo happy for her!<br /><br />

As a side note, registering for the conference allows you the opportunity to submit your resume to the Grace Hopper resume database which is a MUST DO if you are trying to get a job. Lots of companies will browse this database before the conference and offer to set up interviews with you at the conference before you even need to go sell yourself to their booth. The GHC Scholars are in a special subsection of that database and get special note that companies look out for.<br /><br />

Another thing I would do is more of a general advice thing: provide more details on my resume. I had sort of a pretty, minimalist resume going into the conference, but many people helpfully criticized it for its lack of detail on the projects I’ve worked on etc. I was sort of aiming to rely on my in person charmingness (ha) to explain my projects but people pointed out that often the hiring decision is made by someone who you never meet and rely on your resume and any notes the person you talk to make. I have since changed my resume to add more details and also my graduation date, so a tip for other dumb people like me out there, add details of your projects on your resume.<br /><br />

I’m getting tired of writing this post so I’ll wrap up.<br /><br />

TLDR; Try to become a GHC scholar, and if not make sure you at least submit a highly detailed resume into the GHC database. Also if you’re trying for a job, ignore the sessions at GHC and just do the career fair.</p>
